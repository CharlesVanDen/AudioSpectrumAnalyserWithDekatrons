# AudioSpectrumAnalyserWithDekatrons

I started this project with twenty 6802 dekatrons, not really knowing what the end result would be. That's why it was called TwentyDekatrons. 
Then I discovered the MSGEQ7 and it turned into an Stereo Audio Spectrum Analyzer with Dekatrons. And now it's leading to an article in Elektor!
