# AudioSpectrumAnalyserWithDekatrons

I started this project with twenty 6802 dekatrons, not really knowing what the end result would be. That's why it was called TwentyDekatrons. 
Then I discovered the MSGEQ7 and it turned into an Stereo Audio Spectrum Analyzer with only seven Dekatrons. And now it's an article 
in Elektor issue september/ocotober 2022! For the extensive documentation, see: https://www.elektormagazine.nl/labs/i-finally-found-a-useful-application-for-dekatrons and https://www.elektor.com
